mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10].  If the sum of ebx, ecx*4, and 0x10 exceeds the bounds of allocated memory, it will cause a segmentation fault or access violation. This is a common error in assembly programming but often difficult to pinpoint if the incorrect calculation isn't immediately obvious.

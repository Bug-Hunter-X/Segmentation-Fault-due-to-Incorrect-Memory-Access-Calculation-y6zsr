mov ecx, someVariable ;Ensure ecx is within valid bounds
mov eax, someOtherVariable ;Ensure someOtherVariable is a valid address
add ecx, someOffset ;Ensure someOffset doesn't cause overflow
mov ebx, [eax + ecx*4 + 0x10] ;Access memory safely

;To prevent the bug, add error checks before memory access:

;Check if ecx is within bounds
cmp ecx, upperBound
jge handleError ;Jump to error handling if ecx is out of bounds
cmp ecx, lowerBound
jle handleError ;Jump to error handling if ecx is out of bounds

;Check if the resulting address is valid before dereferencing it.  This is OS-specific and often requires accessing system calls.
;...add code to validate the address...

handleError:
; Handle the error appropriately, such as by printing an error message and exiting gracefully.
; This is highly OS-specific and depends on the available system calls.
